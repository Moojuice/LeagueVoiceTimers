League of Legends Voice Activated Timers v1.0
Kyle Liu

Purpose: Now you can control the spawn times of your buffs and baron/drag hands free! Completely voice-automated with synthesized voice to tell you when buffs spawn or 1 minute to spawn. 

Credit goes to annyang for the voice recognition 

Timers can only be activated once each until they finish.

To be implemented in the future: Ability to cancel timer (simple), adding enemy buff timers, a visual timer for users to see if they have dual screens, I also need a secure website (HTTPS) to host the script so the page doesnâ€™t keep asking for microphone

You can find a working version on my website: http://students.cec.wustl.edu/~kyleliu/leagueoflegendsprogram.html

Fixing the CSS/style of the page that I threw together in 5 minutes

I also think it would be fun to record voices and use those samples

Skills: Integration of multiple JS utilities (speech synthesizer) and fellow scripts (annyang) for a clean, streamline script that is hands-free. Knowledge of how to utilize voice features in javascript as well as modularity of multiple functions performing similar roles.
